\n\
While still a pain, she\n\
does start to develop\n\
some skills thanks to her\n\
new 'family' and learns \n\
to settle down...barely.\n\
She meets Mark by chance \n\
while he was exploring \n\
outside her home. Seems\n\
like he was able to deal\n\
with her rowdiness.\n\
Occasionally, he'll \n\
bring her to meet Cream\n\
and Vanilla and have little\n\
playdates, much to \n\
Vanilla's horror.\n\
She does have a tendacy to\n\
follow Tails, whether he \n\
likes it or not. She's a\n\
wiley cat, but deep down\n\
she means well. \n\
When she eventually meets\n\

WHO IS!!!\n\
-Layla the Fox-\n\
Age: 10\n\
Creator: \n\
Magical Poptarts\n\
A young girl who was found \n\
in the woods one day by \n\
Katalina and Mark. She doesn't \n\
talk much about her family \n\
- if she has any. \n\
Despite being alone in\n\
the woods, she seems to\n\
have a knack to survive\n\
the worst. \n\
\n\
Hell, when they found her\n\
initially, she was seen\n\
eating a flicky. Mark was\n\
very impressed while \n\
Katalina was spooked.\n\
Starts to cling around Mark\n\
and is often mistaken for\n\
his daughter. Still, he does\n\
treat her like one, when\n\
she isn't being a hassle. \n\
Has a very cutesy and \n\
childish way of speaking. \n\
Much like Kitten, finds joy\n\
in messing with Mark by \n\
calling him 'Markie'.\n\
Also seems to have a \n\
very odd and unbalanced\n\
skillset. I mean what 10\n\
year old knows how to work\n\
a cannon but can't read???\n\
When she eventually meets\n\
Kitten, the two become\n\
inseparable. A couple\n\
of crazy kids having\n\
fun.\n\
The bond between the \n\
four children ends being \n\
a huge headache for Mark, \n\

Dev Talk: Look, the creator of\n\
her almost destroyed her voice\n\
doing the extra Cream voices so\n\
it's the least I can do.\n\

Also truth be told, I have a\n\
very soft spot for these two \n\
characters. So....creator's\n\
bias strikes again. "))
